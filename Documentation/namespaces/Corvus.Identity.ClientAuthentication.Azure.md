Abstractions for obtaining access tokens suitable for use with client libraries that use the [`Azure.Core`](xref:Azure.Core) components, such as the Azure SDK (after the [redesign that started in 2019](xref:azure-sdk-2019-rewrite)). This does not presume any particular source of tokens. It is designed to work with systems such as Azure Managed Identities, but will work with any system in which a service has some ambient identity of its own.

The [`IServiceIdentityAzureTokenCredentialSource`](xref:Corvus.Identity.ClientAuthentication.Azure.IServiceIdentityAzureTokenCredentialSource) interface provides a way to obtain a [`TokenCredential`](xref:Azure.Core.TokenCredential) that represents the running service's own identity. (E.g., for a service running in Azure in a context that provides a Managed Identity, this provides a way to perform outbound requests through an [`Azure.Core`](xref:Azure.Core)-based client library, authenticating as that Managed Identity.) Implementations of this interface are typically acquired through dependency injection. For example, if you want to use an Azure Managed Identity, the [`AddServiceIdentityAzureTokenCredentialSourceFromAzureCoreTokenCredential`](xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.AzureIdentityServiceCollectionExtensions.AddServiceIdentityAzureTokenCredentialSourceFromAzureCoreTokenCredential(Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.IServiceCollection,Azure.Core.TokenCredential)) or [`AddServiceIdentityAzureTokenCredentialSourceFromLegacyConnectionString`](xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.AzureIdentityServiceCollectionExtensions.AddServiceIdentityAzureTokenCredentialSourceFromLegacyConnectionString*) extension methods for [`IServiceCollection`](xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.IServiceCollection) will make a suitable implementation of [`IServiceIdentityAzureTokenCredentialSource`](xref:Corvus.Identity.ClientAuthentication.Azure.IServiceIdentityAzureTokenCredentialSource) available (and these also supply an implementation of the more general-purpose [`IServiceIdentityAccessTokenSource`](xref:Corvus.Identity.ClientAuthentication.IServiceIdentityAccessTokenSource)).
